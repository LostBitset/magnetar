# magnetar

In Magnetar, a document contains *sections*, which provide *fragments* associated with a specific *concepts*. For example, an `Integration Factors` concept might have an `Equation` fragment, a `Proof` fragment, and several `Example` fragments. You can then look at specific concepts and see everything in one place, even though you didn't write them that way. 

You can easily swich back and forth between viewing a single concept, the source document where a particular fragment came from, or a collection of concepts found in a document or folder.
